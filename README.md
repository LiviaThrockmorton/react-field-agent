# react-field-agent
Front-end react app for a pre-built java back-end.  This was an assignment I completed during my Dev10 training, here are the details:

## Goals
Start a React front-end for the Field Agent HTTP service.

## Set Up
Use the provided Field Agent HTTP Service as your back-end data service.
Create a new React application with Create React App. Use npm to install React Router v6 (npm install react-router-dom@6) as a dependency.

## High-Level Requirements
- Implement a full CRUD UI for agents (display, add, update, and delete).
- Implement the required client-side routes.
- splay a "Not Found" message if a route doesn't match one of the defined routes.
- Create React components as needed to support the required client-side routes.
